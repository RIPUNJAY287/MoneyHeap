        <h3 class="head">What are Pension Plans/Retirement Plans?</h3>

        <p> Retirement Plans are a category of life/annuity plans that are specially designed to meet your post-retirement needs such as medical and living expenses. You would want to maintain the same lifestyle post retirement. There could be an increase in your day-to-day expenses due to an increase in inflation. You would also have post-retirement dreams such as travelling the world, pursuing a hobby, starting a new venture, and more. By planning in advance, you can be financially prepared for your retirement.</p>
        <p>This is where pension plans/retirement plans come in. Both pension plans and retirement plans are a category of life insurance plans that are specially designed to meet your post-retirement needs. To ensure that you can enjoy your golden years with financial independence, these plans help cover your expenses and secure your future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div2" style="background-color: #E67E22">

        <h3 class="head"> Why do I need to plan for my retirement?</h3>

        <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing retirement years</h4>
        <p> With average life expectancy increasing in India, it has become increasingly important to plan for a longer retirement. The life expectancy figures indicate how long an average individual lives. In India, the average life expectancy of a person aged 60 is 18.022 years. This means that an average Indian lives up to the age of 78. Hence, you need to start planning in advance to maintain your lifestyle and take care of other expenses for such a long duration.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight:bold;"> Medical expenses</h4>
        <p> A major worry with increasing age is unforeseen medical expenses. Rising medical costs can be difficult to manage unless you plan for them in advance.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight:bold;"> Financial independence post retirement</h4>
        <p>You would like to live your life on your own terms after your retirement. However, more than 65%^^ individuals above the age of 60 depend on others for their daily expenses. This shows how important it is to plan for your retirement and ensure your financial independence.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit from the power of compounding:</h4>
                <p>
                    The earlier you invest in a retirement plan, the longer your money gets to grow. Also, the interest earned over time gets re-invested to generate more returns. This is called the power of compounding. This provides you a larger amount for your retirement
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>

            </li>

        <h3 class="head">How much do I need to save for retirement?</h3>
        <p>
            When you retire, your regular income stops. However, even during retirement, you would want to maintain your existing lifestyle and be able to support your family. In addition, there could be increased medical expenses. Hence, it is important to calculate your financial requirements for retirement so that you can be prepared well in advance. It is difficult to determine the exact amount you will require post-retirement, however, below are a few factors that you can consider to arrive at the amount:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Your day-to-day expenses</h4>
                <p>

                    This will give you an understanding of how much amount you would need to maintain your current lifestyle even post retirement

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Events and milestones during retirement</h4>
                <p>
                    There could be financial responsibilities even during retirement, such as paying for children’s higher education or wedding, and more. It is important to include these costs while planning for retirement
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Your post-retirement dreams</h4>
                <p>
                    You may have dreams that you would want to fulfil post retirement, such as traveling, starting your own venture, and more. These would require a significant amount and hence, it is necessary to include these while calculating the amount you would need during your retirement
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4><b>Unforeseen costs</b></h4>
                <p>
                    While planning for retirement, you should keep some amount aside for any uncertainty, such as medical expenses, or any financial emergency
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 style="font-weight:bold; ">Inflation</h4>
                <p>
                    This leads to an increase in the costs of goods and services, which requires you to pay an additional amount to consume the same goods and services at a later period. For example, if your current expenses amount to ₹ 6 lakh annually at the age of 45, to maintain the same lifestyle post retirement, you would require ₹ 14.38 lakh annually at the age of 60 assuming 6% inflation year-on-year. Hence, while calculating the amount you would need for your retirement, it is important to factor in inflation as well

                </p>

            <h4>
                <b>It should cover your expenses post retirement</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Once you retire and your regular source of income stops, your pension needs to cover all your expenses. This includes your day-to-day expenses, travel expenses, your child’s education, wedding expenses, and more.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>
                <b>It should provide income for life</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                As the regular income stops during retirement, it is important that the pension plan covers all your expenses for life. There are pension plans that offer annuity payments throughout your life. This will help you stay financially prepared to meet your post retirement expenses.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>
              <b>  It should provide inflation-beating returns</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                As time passes, with rising inflation, the cost of goods and services increase. This means that you will need a larger amount to maintain even the same standard of living post retirement. Thus, you should look for a plan that provides returns that can cover for inflation as well.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>
               <b> It should cover medical emergencies</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                It is important that your pension plan provides you financial cover in case of a medical emergency. Some pension plans provide financial protection against critical illnesses and disability due to an accident. This can be helpful in case of a medical emergency during retirement.

        <p>
            You can invest in pension plans any time as per your requirements and convenience. However, the sooner you invest, the better it is. You will have more time to contribute to your retirement savings and allow your money to grow. Also, if you invest early, you can contribute lower amounts over time as compared to when you are older. This way, you will be able to invest a large amount for your retirement over time without impacting your current budget.
