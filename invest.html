        <h3 class="head3">What is Financial Goal Planning?</h3>
        <p> Financial Goal planning refers to setting financial goals and developing plans to achieve them. Your financial goals can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Short-term goals can be achieved within a span of one to three years. Examples are building an emergency fund or investing for a vacation. The medium-term financial goals could be buying a car or an SUV.</p>

        <p>
            The long-term financial goals usually take a longer span of 10-15 years or even more. Examples are planning for retirement, buying a home, or saving for your child’s education and marriage. You must always invest for your financial goals based on the time horizon and risk profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            Financial goals such as children’s marriage, buying a house, or a car are high-value goals. You must plan and invest your money to achieve these goals over a longer period of time. Financial goal planning helps you decide where to put your money. You can select the best investments based on your risk appetite and stay on track to achieve your financial goals.
        </p>

        <p>  Financial goal planning helps you to get more organised with your money. For example, you would have to cut down on excessive spending to achieve a financial goal such as saving for your children’s higher education. </p>

        <h3 class="head3">Why are financial goals important?</h3>
        <p> Financial goals are important for funding your lifestyle, both in and outside of the workplace. It's helpful to divide financial goals into short-, medium- and long-term objectives. In the short term, it's helpful to reduce debt, create a savings account and create a budget that accommodates your lifestyle. In the medium and long term, it's useful to focus on financial stability and retirement planning. These are some of the benefits of creating financial goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Increased financial freedom
            </li>
            <li> More comfortable retirement</li>
            <li>Less debt</li>
            <li>Increased security in emergency situations</li>
            <li>Better lifestyle for you and your family</li>

    <div class="div" style="background-color: #EFA13E ">
        <h3 class="head3">Reasons/why for Financial goals</h3>
        <p>We as humans we tend to look ahead in time, for a need or for a nesscity, for that we put goals</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dream House</li>
            <li>Child Education</li>

        <h3 class="head3">Investment Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            Investment objectives are classified into two—primary and secondary. Primary objectives comprise the most important financial goals. For example, securing a secondary source of income, holding an asset long-term, ensuring financial safety, etc., can be the primary objective of investing.

            Secondary objectives rank lower in priority; they add to the primary objective. Tax savings and liquidity are some common examples of secondary objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typically, investments are assets bought in the present with the expectation that they would yield higher returns in the future. Over a period, investments can generate either profits or losses. The income generated by investments can fulfill financial goals—overcoming income shortages, debt repayment, education, student loans, etc.

            Along with purchasing power, individual goals are crucial in selecting the right investment. In a portfolio, the individual’s goals determine the allocation of funds. In addition, investors consider their risk appetite, maturity period, and expected returns
